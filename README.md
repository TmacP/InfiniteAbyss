# Welcome to InfiniteAbyss

This project is my first time using Defold. I created it so I could test out how Defold compares to Unity. This is a work in progress still in the prototype phase. The intention is to be a single player, pixel art, 2d underwater platformer. It is based off of the game [Infinite Abyss](https://infinite-abyss.pages.dev/) I was part of the team which developed for Computer Science 306 at the University of Saskatchewan.


Check out my [dev log](https://tristenmacpherson.pages.dev/blog/blog-index) to see what I'm up to.
